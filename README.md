# The Georgia Cystic Fibrosis Data Warehouse
The CRIC at Emory is developing a secure, HIPPA compliant, cloud-based data warehouse â€“ the Georgia CF Data Warehouse - that will be a repository for all CF-related clinical and research laboratory data. The data warehouse will facilitate the entry, storage, and retrieval of all data generated by the research cores, research data from individual CF investigators using samples from the CF-BR, and clinical data available from the CFF Patient Registry and the electronic medical record (EMR). The data warehouse will facilitate controlled exchange of information across projects and cores. Thus, the major goal of the CRIC is to enhance the validity, clarity, and interpretation of results both within and among the projects on CF clinical and translational research while ensuring the accumulation and sharing of data in a secure and confidential manner.
